# partialspoof-metrics

This repository dedicated to metrics for partial spoof evaluation

## Support metrics
- Utterance-based EER
- Frame-based EER
- Millisecond EER
  - Same idea as [Range-based EER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17739) but simpler and faster implementation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1

## Contributions
Metrics are very important for research evaluation and can be very tricky to implement.
If you find any bug or unsastifactory implementation or want to add new test feel free to create a new topic in issue.
